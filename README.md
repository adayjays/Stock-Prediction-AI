# Project: Stock prediction With AI

## Progress Update - September 4, 2023

### Process Description

This script is a Python web scraper built using the Selenium library. It automates the process of downloading data from the NASDAQ Stock Screener website. The script simulates a headless Firefox browser to access the webpage, click on the "Download Data" button, and download the data in a structured format.

### Recent Updates

- Improved error handling for more robust execution.
- Updated waiting times for better page load synchronization.
- Added detailed comments to the code for clarity.

### Accomplishments

- Successfully automated the data download process from the NASDAQ Stock Screener website.
- Achieved better code organization and readability through comments and documentation.
- Improved the script's stability by handling exceptions and errors effectively.

### Challenges

- One challenge was ensuring that the script waits for the webpage to fully load before attempting to download the data. This required fine-tuning waiting times.
- Handling potential changes to the NASDAQ website's structure or behavior to ensure the script remains functional.

### Next Steps

- Cleaning the data and putting the downloaded data into a database

### Upcoming Milestones

-   Identify and Collect Historical Data	Sept 16 - Sept 20	
-   Clean and Preprocess Data	Sept 21 - Sept 25	
-   Transform Data Format	Sept 26 - Sept 30
